<h2 id="traffic">Traffic</h2>

However not all trafic is good. We need the trafic that is looking for our product. So there for its importent to make content that is relevant to the search. and not just make popular content. 
The only exception is if you make money on ads. Then you want as much trafic as possible. </p>
<h1 id="what-affects-seo-ranking-">What affects SEO ranking?</h1>
<h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h2>
<p>When the webcrawlers want to visit sites. They can crawl through links . The primary purpose of a sitemap is to list URLs to ensure that search engines can find and crawl them. Sitemaps usually include basic information such as the URL, last modification date, change frequency, and priority of the pages on your site.</p>
<p>For our github-pages we made a <a href="./../sitemap.xml">sitemap </a> here all the urls are listed. </p>
<p>We can use this to create a visual sitemap or use in in google console to make sure google can find all the pages. and faster <img src="image-2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h2 id="metaheader">Metaheader</h2>
<p>In the header of a HTML page there can ber stored some meta data. 
like in this <a href="./../q03/src/index.html">q03 index</a> 
The meta data tag have 4 properties: description, keywords, author, and viewport.  </p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;meta <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"description"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"This is the description of my website"</span>&gt;
&lt;meta <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"keywords"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4, etc."</span>&gt;

&lt;meta <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"author"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"Ninjaneer127, MathiasSchjoedt-Bavngaard, Sirety"</span>&gt;

&lt;meta <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"viewport"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The description is used to describe the website. This is used by the search engine to describe the website. and is also used to describe the website in the search results. (this is especially important becouse this could be the first thing a user sees about your website.) </p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>So why are content important for the search engine?
The search engine wants to give the user the best experience. Therefor it will try to give the user the best content. This is also scored by the users. If a user clicks on a link and then quickly leaves the page again, the search engine will see that the user did not find what he was looking for. This will then affect the ranking of the page. For those search terms.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>To make sure SE knows what category your website belongs to, it looks at the links of your webpage. 
it will also use these klinks to &quot;crawl&quot; through a site. </p>
<h3 id="internal">Internal</h3>
<p>The internal links - the links on your page that links to your ownb site. These links are used to calculate usability and to se what pages are connected. </p>
<h3 id="external">external</h3>
<p>The External links are both outcoing and incomming., </p>
<p>The outgoing links are the ones that you say your weebsite looks like. This way services like google can see what you want your website to look like
The incommin links are other peoble that link to your website. Both the number of links affects you SEO &quot;score&quot; but also the correct type of links. Fx. if i own a potato buissness its good that pages that premote potatoes / vegstibles linkes to my site. Like a Health blog saying; &quot;this is a place you can get good potatoes for your salat&quot; is much better, than a page explaining how a atomic clock works and mentions a potato and then linking to you potato shop maybe just to link to the people who don&#39;t know what a potato is. 
Now this link from the atomic power page is maybe not what your customers normaly look for. There for that link wont be as vlauable as the helth blog one. </p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>To get a good SEO score you need to have a good performance. This means how well your website performs. in terms of core web vitals. 
The better your website performs the better your SEO score will be and higher ranking. </p>
<h1 id="core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-core-web-vitals-">What is Core Web Vitals?</h2>
<p>Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics introduced by Google to measure the user experience of a web page. These metrics focus on loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability, which are crucial for delivering a smooth and engaging user experience. The three main Core Web Vitals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.</li>
  <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> Measures interactivity. Pages should have a FID of less than 100 milliseconds.</li>
  <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Measures visual stability. Pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics are important because they help ensure that a website is not only fast but also stable and responsive, providing a better overall experience for users.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</strong> SSR ensures that the HTML is generated on the server for each request, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content.</li>
  <li><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG):</strong> SSG generates static HTML pages at build time, which can be served quickly and efficiently, improving load times and SEO.</li>
  <li><strong>API Routes:</strong> Next.js allows the creation of API endpoints, which can be used to fetch data and enhance the dynamic nature of a web application without sacrificing SEO.</li>
